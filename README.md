# Personal Video CMS

Minimal personal video CMS using your own Airtable as the backend. From the user's perspective, this app allows you to:

- Upload videos via a password-protected route.
- Share a public list of all assets via their title and a thumbnail.
- View individual videos.

There are no management routes for deleting or editing assets, but you should just be going straight to your Airtable base for that!

## What you'll need to deploy this:

- A copy of the [Airtable template](https://airtable.com/universe/expKKXTgmWJ76BmVL/airtable-personal-video-cms).
- Your Airtable API key and base ID from above.
- Mux Access Token.
